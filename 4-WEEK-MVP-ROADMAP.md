Perfect — let’s design this like a **true lean MVP**, not an overbuilt SaaS.

Goal:
👉 Launch a usable web app in 4 weeks
👉 Get real teachers using it
👉 Collect feedback before building advanced features

We focus on **speed, simplicity, and validation**.

# 🗓 4-Week Lean MVP Roadmap

Product: Classroom Timer Web App (PWA)

---

# ✅ Week 1 — Validate + Design (No Coding Overkill)

## 🎯 Goal:

Confirm teachers actually want this _before_ building too much.

---

## 1️⃣ Define Narrow Positioning

Instead of “Timer for teachers”

Go with:

> “The fastest classroom timer for daily lesson transitions.”

That’s it. Clear and focused.

---

## 2️⃣ Competitive Snapshot (1 Day Only)

Look at:

- Google “classroom timer”
- ClassroomScreen
- Online Stopwatch
- YouTube teacher timer videos

Identify:

- What they lack (too cluttered, too childish, too generic)

Do NOT over-research. Move fast.

---

## 3️⃣ Wireframe (Low Fidelity)

Design 3 screens only:

1. Home screen (preset buttons)
2. Active timer screen
3. Simple preset edit modal

Keep:

- Big bold timer
- 5 preset buttons
- Dark/light mode toggle

Tools:

- Figma
- Or even pen & paper

---

## 4️⃣ Landing Page (Validation Page)

Build a simple 1-page site:

Headline:

> “A classroom timer built for teachers — fast, simple, visible.”

Sections:

- Screenshot mockup
- 3 benefits
- Email waitlist form

Goal:
👉 Collect 50–100 teacher emails before full launch

---

# ✅ Week 2 — Core Timer Build

## 🎯 Goal:

Functional timer working in browser.

---

## Tech Stack (Lean & Fast)

- React (Next.js or Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Local storage (no backend yet)
- Deploy on Vercel

No database.
No login.
No payments.

---

## Build Only These Features:

### 1️⃣ Countdown Timer

- Set minutes/seconds
- Start / Pause / Reset
- Completion sound

---

### 2️⃣ 5 Default Presets

- 2 min
- 5 min
- 10 min
- 15 min
- 20 min

---

### 3️⃣ Full-Screen Mode

- Clean
- Large font
- Progress circle or bar

---

### 4️⃣ Visual Warning

- Color change at 1 min
- Flash at 10 seconds

---

## End of Week 2 Deliverable:

A live URL teachers can use in class.

Even if ugly. It must work reliably.

---

# ✅ Week 3 — Polish for Classroom Reality

## 🎯 Goal:

Make it “classroom-proof”.

---

## Add:

### 1️⃣ Custom Presets

- Rename
- Save to local storage

---

### 2️⃣ Better Visibility

- Extra large font option
- High contrast toggle
- Clean typography

Test:
Open it on a TV or projector.
Walk 5–8 meters away.
If you can’t read it — fix it.

---

### 3️⃣ PWA Setup

- Installable on tablet
- Offline capable
- App-like experience

---

### 4️⃣ Collect Feedback

Email your waitlist:

Subject:

> “Can you test this classroom timer in your next lesson?”

Ask:

- What’s annoying?
- What’s missing?
- Would you pay $20/year?

This is critical.

---

# ✅ Week 4 — Validation + First Growth Loop

## 🎯 Goal:

Confirm teachers use it repeatedly.

---

## 1️⃣ Analytics (Minimal)

Add:

- Daily active users
- Sessions per day
- Preset clicks

Use:

- Plausible
- PostHog
- Or simple Vercel analytics

No heavy tracking.

---

## 2️⃣ Improve Based on Feedback

You’ll likely hear:

- “Can I create a lesson sequence?”
- “Can I remove sound?”
- “Can I change colors?”

Pick ONE improvement only.

Don’t build everything.

---

## 3️⃣ Soft Launch Strategy

Post in:

- Teacher Facebook groups
- Reddit r/Teachers
- LinkedIn educator communities

Position as:

> “Built this simple classroom timer because I was frustrated with cluttered ones. Would love feedback.”

Do not sell yet.
Get usage first.

---

# 🚦 What You DO NOT Build in MVP

❌ Accounts
❌ Payments
❌ Sync
❌ Analytics dashboard
❌ School licensing
❌ Gamification
❌ LMS integration

All of that comes AFTER retention validation.

---

# 📊 MVP Success Criteria

After 4 weeks, you want:

- 100+ teachers tried it
- 30% return usage
- 5+ teachers say they’d pay
- At least 10 unsolicited “this is helpful” responses

If that happens → build Pro version.

If not → pivot.
